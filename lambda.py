# Program to show the use of lambda functions
double = lambda x: x * 2

print(double(5))


# In the above program, lambda x: x * 2 is the lambda function. Here x is the argument and x * 2 is the expression that gets evaluated and returned.

# This function has no name. It returns a function object which is assigned to the identifier double. We can now call it as a normal function.
# similar code:
# def double(x):
#   return x * 2
