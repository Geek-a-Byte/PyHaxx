## Motivation ^_^

I know learning a new thing needs the answer to “WHY SHOULD I EVEN LEARN THIS STUFF? HOW CAN I APPLY THIS LEARNING IN PRACTICAL LIFE?”. So here we go for the answer now..

Python is necessary not only for software devs but also for an accountant, an economic expert, a marketer, a finance expert, a genetic engineer and also for higher study enthusiasts.

A common question of newbie programmers these days is  why should I learn python first instead of C/C++?
The simple answer starts with a simple question “Why Shouldn’t You?”  

> Python is easy to learn compared to C, C++ or java. It is one of the top programming languages of 2021.

> Python has a wide range of libraries which are used in big projects. These library functions are customizable.

> Python is an open source language meaning you can develop library functions of python yourself.

> Python supports cross platform development. What is cross platform development? If you develop an android application it would work in IOS as well. Even if you develop a desktop application it can be executed in any operating systems WINDOWS or LINUX

> Python has two very famous frameworks for backend development. Flask and Django (read it jango). So for job preparation one can prepare him/herself learning any of the two frameworks very well. 

> In higher studies , in different sectors python is needed badly. Such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Data Science.

> The job sector for python is huge. You can be a web dev, software dev, data scientist, business analyst, ML engineer, game dev, network programmer and what not. 

So if you excel in only one programming language python, then your career will have the boost it needs for sure <3.
